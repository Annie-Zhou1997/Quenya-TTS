# Quneya TTS

This project is a Quneya TTS created using ToucanTTS. It is a master's thesis project for the MSc in Voice Technology at the University of Groningen.

Based on the tutorial from the original repository, I have added Quneya language (`qya`) support in the `Preprocessing\TextFrontend.py` file and created the Quneya language G2P script, which is also located in the Preprocessing directory.
